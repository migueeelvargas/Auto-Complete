Special thanks to the Gui team: Galen Krulce, Huajie Ajax Wu, Becky Huayin Zhou, Raymond Shi

For without them, the GUI for this PA would not be possible. They have gone through long, hard nights and learned how to code in QT from scratch to produce this beautiful code in roughly a week. All the while they put up with spontaneous source file changes, my design suggestions and my lack of punctuality, and they made sure this GUI launched with the assignment. For any students who read this, please let any of the GUI team that you see know that they are awesome and are dripping with awesomesauce. --Jor-el
